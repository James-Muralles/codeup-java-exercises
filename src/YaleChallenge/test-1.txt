Peter Parker was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level.[116] Academically brilliant, Peter has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. Even Reed Richards, the most intelligent individual in the Marvel universe and a prolific scientist in his own right, has acknowledged that Peterâ€™s knowledge of biology surpasses his own, admitting that Peter can think of a problem from a biology perspective where he would be unable to do so, since his expertise lies in physics. After his years of crime-fighting, Spider-Man has honed his fighting skills into an equivalent of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat skills that is unique to his spider-powers, able to hold his own against formidable supervillains such as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Chameleon, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro, Lizard, Scorpion, Kraven the Hunter, and Venom. His fighting style is unique and specific to him and, as such, it is incredibly difficult to combat against.
